vagrant init : used to start a vagrant project . 
it will create a vagrant file which will be the manager file for all the virtuel machin . 
2) choose box to use for vagrant . 
from vagrantup/box
copy the commend from there
3) to satrt vagrant : vagrant up 
4) to list the box that you have running : 
vagrant  box list
5) you can ssh to the virtuel machin : 
 vagrant ssh
6) 
vagrant box remove 
vagrant status 
vagrant halt 			: stop the machin 
vagrant provision :update changes from you file while it's running .
vagrant reload 
7) now for the vm machin that you want to work on , you can add some script on it via the vagrant file. 
creat a script shell file = script.sh 
add the script to your file . 
once it's done then point your vagrnat file on the script file .
config.vm.provision:sehll, path:"script.sh" 


the idea of those script is to make run your programme automaticaly once the machin is running . 
to run sepecific app on the Vagrant VM you can add your commed to the script.sh file 
and then forward your app port in the vagrant vm file. 
config.vm.provision:sehll, path:"script.sh" 
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host:8080 


========
you can also genrate your vagrant file online .
so if you want to select how much RAM ,CPU, disque the you machin shoul dget you can do that . 
=======
Note : vagrant will automaticly delete evry thing that you do on the VM once it closed .
